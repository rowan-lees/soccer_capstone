#+TITLE: Prelim EDA
* DONE Gain understanding of the entire dataset
* DONE create new dataframes by join different tables

#+TITLE: Data Transformation
* DONE turn home_team_result into separate columns using get_dummies - not necessary as this is the target variable
* DONE transform date into day of week and month
* DONE Data leakage from five day form and previous season form? - chatGPT doesn't think this will be a problem
* DONE Null values for five_form_pts, what to impute?  - imputed zero for the moment, but should change this
* DONE convert five_form_pts into integer
* DONE drop 5_day_form for the moment
* DONE going to need to drop lots of columns, which ones specifically?
* DONE do we care about the team_name, or should we drop?  - dropped
* DONE OHE country, and drop league_id
* DONE to convert day, OHE
* DONE to convert season,
* DONE change target variable into 0,1,2 instead of 0,1,3
* DONE five match GD
* DONE goal df from prev game

* TODO add in the team attributes to the match data
* TODO impute data for null values?
* TODO add in previous year's ranking 
* TODO for NAN 5 match form values, change from 0 to something else?
* TODO OHE for both home and away team name


#+TITLE: ML models
* TODO Try to reduce overfitting? 


#+TITLE: maybe tasks
* TODO add away team result to initial table?

#+TITLE: Problems to solve
* TODO There is no information about league position/points accumulated prior to the game, need to calculate this

#+TITLE: Things to consider
* Explainability is very important

#+TITLE: Other business problem ideas
* CNN, identify team of player based on pictures fed into model. Helpful for sports journalists. Flaws, going to be a fairly small sample size, unless photographers upload thousands of photos to db.  Also, the jerseys change every year.
